      <article>
        <p class="darkslategray-text">Hi, I'm Rachael. Currently, I'm a Graphic Designer/Marketing Specialist for Cornish College of the Arts. At Cornish, I have created a variety of pieces used to increase scholarship funding for students at Cornish.  I have extensive experience as a Graphic Designer in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors.  In June 2018, I graduated with a Master of Arts in Nonprofit Leadership. Along with my experience in the graphics field, I have over eight years of educational and professional experience in working within the Marketing, Events, and Hospitality fields.  I am detail-orientated, possess strong time, organizational, and project management skills. I complete all projects while working under strict time constraints, with a strong ability to manage time, people, and several projects at once.
          My future goal is to start my own nonprofit.</p>
